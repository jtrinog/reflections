What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a directory, git starts tracking changes to added files in the directory. It is necessary to initialize the repository to inform git that the contents of the folder will have files that will be added to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose which files you would like to group together to commit as a group.  It allows you to make changes before "commmiting" to a commit.  Helps to keep your log cleaner.
